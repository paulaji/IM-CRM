# set the base image as Python version which we are using
# base image refers to the starting point of a Docker container
FROM python:3.11.3

# this env is specific to Docker
# The line `ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1` sets the environment variable `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` to `1` within the Docker container. This instructs Python to use unbuffered output for the standard streams (stdout and stderr). Unbuffered output ensures that the logs and output generated by Python applications running inside the container are immediately flushed and visible in real-time, which can be beneficial for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# set a working directory
# all our files can be then copied into the app directory of the Docker container
WORKDIR /app

# add/copy the requirements.txt file to the working directory app we set
COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt

# install the Python dependencies from requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# now copy the rest of the project files to the working directory app
COPY . /app/
