python -m venv virt // to setup virtual env
virt/Scripts/activate // to activate the virtual environment
pip install django // to install django
pip install mysql // to install mysql
pip install mysql-connector-python // connection to mysql
django-admin startproject imcrm // to create/template django project
python manage.py startapp website // to create an app (smaller component of a project)
inside the app, we created (in this case, called website), we can create static named folder to serve static files such css, js or images
add the app you just created (website) in settings.py, change database to mysql

python mydb.py // to check for the database connection
go to mysql workbench and now refresh the schemas! you can find your schema there

python manage.py migrate // after connecting to database, we need to push it into django

winpty python manage.py createsuperuser // to create a superuser or admin
python manage.py runserver // to run the server

NOTE: before running the server, click on the run button in the manage.py file, this will activate the virtual environment, then navigate into dir with manage.py and then
python manage.py
OR 
do it the programmers way
.\virt\Scripts\activate // this command in the root dir will activate the virtual environment
then cd into the dir with the main file and // python manage.py runserver  // voila!

NOTE: we can always add new users through the django admin panel, for small projects, this will do
but here, we can look at manual ways to register users (preferring the django method though!)
